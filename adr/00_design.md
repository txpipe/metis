# SuperNode Project Design Document

## Project Overview:
"SuperNode" is an infrastructure orchestration layer that unifies the operational aspects of running a diverse set of nodes, processes, and services from multiple blockchains. Our solution is tailored for Cardano SPOs, enabling them to leverage their existing knowledge and infrastructure to increase their revenue stream by offering security to connected Partnerchains.

## Architectural Design: Kubernetes as the Core Orchestration Layer
The SuperNode architecture is built on top of Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system. All core components of the SuperNode, including the UI, monitoring stack, and the partnerchain nodes themselves, will be packaged and deployed as containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.

### Reasons for this choice:

1. Versatility and "Run It Anywhere": Kubernetesâ€™s design allows it to run consistently across various environments, from major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) to on-premise data centers and bare-metal servers. This directly addresses the project goal of being infrastructure-agnostic.

2. Leveraging Existing Expertise: By using a widely adopted and battle-tested platform like Kubernetes, we can leverage the extensive knowledge base and operational experience of the SPO community and our own team, reducing the need to build a bespoke orchestration engine from scratch.

3. Built-in Features: Kubernetes provides robust, out-of-the-box functionality for key project requirements, including automated provisioning and scaling, service discovery, load balancing, self-healing, high availability, and secure secrets management.

4. "Bring Your Own Cloud" Support: The use of Kubernetes as a portable abstraction layer makes it feasible to provide simple deployment scripts (e.g., Terraform or custom shell scripts) that enable SPOs to deploy the SuperNode directly on their preferred cloud provider account.

### Extensions and Management

The SuperNode platform is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy integration of new Partnerchains.

* **Extensions as Helm Charts**: Each Partnerchain will be packaged as an "extension" using a Helm chart. This standard approach simplifies the onboarding process and allows for easy management and versioning of each integration.

* **Cost and Reward Definition**: Every extension must have a clear definition of its operational costs and the rewards it provides. This will be an integral part of the extension's metadata.

* **Management UI**: A dedicated management UI will serve as the primary interface for SPOs. This UI will provide a "Partnerchain onboarding wizard" to provision and control these extensions. It will automate the deployment of the respective Helm charts and other required infrastructure components.

* **Clear Feedback on Metrics**: The management UI will provide clear, real-time feedback to the SPO on the rewards generated by each extension and the corresponding operational costs. This transparent feedback loop will enable SPOs to make informed decisions about which Partnerchains to support.
