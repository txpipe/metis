# GCloud Bootstrap (Coming Soon)

This directory will host the tooling for provisioning the Metis supernode on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

Planned content:

- Required Google Cloud project setup and IAM roles.
- CLI dependencies (`gcloud`, `kubectl`, `helm`) and installation steps.
- Configurable parameters (project ID, region/zone, node pools).
- Links to GCloud and GKE documentation for further reference.

Implementation is pending; the provider script currently exits with a placeholder message.
