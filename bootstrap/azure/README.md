# Azure Bootstrap (Coming Soon)

This directory will contain the automation for deploying the Metis supernode on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Planned content:

- Required Azure subscriptions, service principals, and role assignments.
- CLI dependencies (`az`, `kubectl`, `helm`) and installation details.
- Configurable parameters (resource group, region, node pools).
- Links to Azure AKS documentation and best practices.

Implementation work is pending; the provider script currently emits a placeholder message.
